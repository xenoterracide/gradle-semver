# Semver Plugin

A semantic versioning plugin that derives the version from git tags and commits and is configuration cache safe.

_Plugin ID_: `"com.xenoterracide.gradle.semver"`
_Plugin GAV_: `"com.xenoterracide.gradle:semver:0.12.+"
_Version_: `0.12.+`

## Usage

```kt
plugins {
  id("com.xenoterracide.gradle.semver")
}

version = semver.provider.get()
```

This is the simplest way to get your semver, but I don't recommend it
because [Gradle isn't lazy with anything related to publishing](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/29342). Even
when it becomes lazy I doubt it'll be as lazy as you want. So I do the following, and then only set `IS_PUBLISHING` in
my publishing build in CI. This avoids constant configuration cache busting as well as ensuring that IO is kept to a
minimum. The `semver.provider` should never have a `null` result under any circumstances; if it does that is a bug.

```kt
import org.semver4j.Semver

version =
  providers
    .environmentVariable("IS_PUBLISHING")
    .flatMap { semver.provider }
    .getOrElse(Semver.ZERO)
```

if you want you can expose whether your tree is dirty or not.

```kt
semver {
  checkDirty.set(true) // expensive since it invalidates the configuration cache every change
}

logger.quiet("semver " + semver.provider.get() // 0.1.1-alpha.0.1+branch.topic-foo.git.32.3aae11e.dirty
```

The plugin exposes a `Semver`. See [Semver4J](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.semver4j/semver4j/latest/index.html).
